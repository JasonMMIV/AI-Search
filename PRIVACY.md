Thank you for using "AI Search," our Chrome extension! We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing a secure and transparent user experience.

**This extension does not collect any user data.**

All data generated, stored, or modified by this extension is confined solely to your local Chrome browser. This means:

However, if you choose to configure and use your own Large Language Model (LLM) API or search API within the extension, certain usage data will be sent directly from your browser to those specific API endpoints as part of their normal operation. This data transmission is solely between your browser and the API service you have chosen to use.
